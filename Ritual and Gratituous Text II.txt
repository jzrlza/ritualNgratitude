							Just finding money or living alone are not the only ways out, being reasonable and being goaled for well-being are far more important (in reality, well-being is not so easy to built)

							Every game I play, every cartoon I watch, consume the use of the well-being that is not easy to be made. One way to be mindful.

							I can alter my schedule and behavior and mindset to get what I want both directly and indirectly, that is the most basic principle of changing life.
							It goes by starting from where I am to where I want to go, know this principle to gain more control of it.

							Be sure I keep ritualizing to align my mind, 
								otherwise I am in danger of having my mind making me doing things to get what I don't want. This is a warning.

							I also need to be aware that problems in life are mostly social management test, it is not about solving things just for self satisfaction like physics problem at all.
							Change the way I think about obstacles, 
								things that get in the way of mine getting what I want. 
									When I look at them instead as opportunities, my approach changes, and I can get much further.


							Forcing people to make them do what I want is not communication. Its not changing minds and its certainly not winning hearts and minds.
								Its tribalism, avoid it as much as possible in normal, peaceful circumstances, now when it comes to selling.

							Civilization can be better when everyone knows what is needed to be responsible first before entertainment.

							I must be happy having growth mindset, not fixed mindset which risks having bad surprises.
							I shall never listen to metalic music, just classic music, to arrange my mind, because of how my brain works.

							The more than 60000 income can come from my dad or mom, since right now I am busy studying, and I am healing my mental health
								I shall pray wish their best luck and effort, this is the easiest way to get what I want and need right now

							The more money income I mentioned is for the use of more social purpose, more female and some male friends, more real life stuff to talk about

							**I can bath myself with all remaining desired earthly happiness with well-being until I'm bored by discovering all the truth, 
								and be responsible of my soul later to set it free from the world.
								Also give credit and be aware of the possible side-effects to minimize it.

A most happy and relaxed possible person living on earthy happiness is the one who comsume happiness with gratefulness, and responsibility, that is the truth
As the world of work can be far more harsh and unforgiving than studying life.
The opposite (stealer, non-grateful) will suffer from the side effects of the materialistic happiness.
