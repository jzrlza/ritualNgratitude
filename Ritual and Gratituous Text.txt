After i look back in my historic records till today
I've got parent income After break
I've got dorm to love to live
I've got chance to chillout at break
I've got chance for my income after break
I've got chance for fixing myself mostly After break
I've got chance to contribute changes During break
I've got chance to get to be loved At break
I've got chance to listen to my most fun and loved music during break
I've got chance to help myself out during break
I've got enough money to give and keep and use

Only living things can both love and hate back , while need love
non living things even fictional beings are meant to be used only
