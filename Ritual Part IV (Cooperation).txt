For just before starting cooperation
-I can take what I've learned from the international Singaporean adaptation to adapt to new environment, I thank you Singapore. And I still care about Thailand's brighter hi-tech future
-I can be ready about my knowledges, skills, and my determination
-I can get to cooperation work place easily, saving time and money as much as possible
-I can get the job I can really do
-I can interview and do the resume to fit the needs of the company and my true abilities and my determination
-I can do any of these, game dev, front-end dev, security dev, blockchain dev
-I can get the cooperation workplace with the flexible morning time, late is ok but secondary


For during 6 months of cooperation, hope this is going smooth, along with extra phone fixing job
-I can keep my schedule time flexible and keep on the work
-I can do the work as long as I learn
-I can do the work and relax as the time fits
-I can ask whatever is new and important to learn, I can be reasonable a lot and calm and wise for the principle to get the success result

Core
-I can use the table of skills and knowledges to record and look up what I am going to do about software development, as for mobile phone fixing, I'll do the same thing, for the sake of long lived job, not just certificate.


For any rituals
-I can plan for the trip to Japan, somewhere educational and exciting or relaxing if alone, or with friends.
-I can make the survival table for going oversea trips, such as battery chargers. And so on in small details. Use it to prepare things to survive carefully. Hotels, attractions, immigrations, etc. from the job incomes.
-I can always be physically safe and mentally safe every trips.
-I can save my money from turning SGD to THB almost 10000 THB value, to save it for Japan trip, and not for rich-like eating, eat like middle class.
-For every trips, I can secure and prepare how to get back to hotel shelter every time more correctly. No more waiting long outside. Just get in when I need to.
-I can take care of my communication device, as in need for contactions. Take one charger for travel, one for stationary every place.
-I can balance and handle my sex feelings along the way.

-I can satisfy the basic needs, security needs, esteem needs, and freedom needs, and acceptance needs.
-Health is part of survival, in longggg term, everyone needs as the building block of happy mind]
-I am certain humans will revert back to herbivore, but civilized
-I am thankful about my parents' income, I will find the best way to thank them according to life situation (I will make the best situation as much as possible, such as health then finance)

-I can use the money I got from scholarship plus lending for japan for most fun and prepared and safe trip, and to satisfy health business for long-term well-being and ego satisfiction
-I feel that nature is willing to balance the world of humans, by removing useless people out from the world by means of luck, if exceed the given 3 chances to fix. Apply to me as well.
The removal means DEATH.
-I feel that I am only to give my time, efforts to benefit only useful people in the world. Useless people are given 3 chances to improve self to be useful.
-I feel that I can plan and strategy things ahead, no matter helping people, or doing things I want those are big and long

-I feel thankful that I can have good health self, parents, friends, bosses, managers, employers, employees, undlings, and many more valueable and to-be-valueable people.
I can be wisly kind to them, I wish from my pure heart for them to have well-being in long term
-No matter live or die, short or long life, I can stay as happy as possible
-I feel thankful that I can develop and maintain socialable and reliable habits, have great social awareness, not just theory and knowledges
and people trust me more and I trust other people geniunely, reminding me that money is social, so as math is tool for social,
all kinds of works are social, no totally personal, higher rank is even more social, cartoons and games are also social, no matter how nerdy it is, it is social
not lonesome logical (which is rather difficult wild hunting) [as we are naturally herbivore]
Sure, cartoons and games have both good and bad examples, learn from good, unlearn from bad. I do know what's good or bad, judging from Minecraft.
Some of the most rewarding benefit of being sociable is, connections that can later save life, cooperation to extend life, sex for fun or for repopulate, friendly imagination world sharing
Sure I can just masterbate if I don't wanna repopulate myself, or surfing internet world, they must be done in proper time, separated from success story yet co-exist
May I donor sperms to lesbians as a way to help repopulate. I am happy single, unless the lastname system is removed fair and square, fair and square.
-I feel that I will rather fulfil my earthy desire, leaving fulfil is better than running away, it determines better place for soul to go, (the desired future determines the present)
-I feel that people can "thank you" to me, see me as earthy hero by my geniune efforts no matter small or big, short or long term. I can have fun solving problems this way.
-For whatever I don't need, I can always focus on the opposite of it, then suspect facts and do principles. To get what I exactly need. 

-I can be a happy atheist, and my parents accept me this way, they can have chances to be strong with being atheists, yet I also have morals which are reasonable.
-My parents can be more acceptance of new things, turn on thier mind to happiness more.
-Just as then I can spread the Law of Materialization of Existence to the parts of the world for more balanced world to live.

Making HCI subject more reasonable and more fits its name.
-I am sure happy that the new teacher who allows open book exam, teach interesting class and give learnable exercise to think, not just remembering or reading, give free materials and sheets, be kind to students, yet grade fairly, and think that teaching must done with heart-ship and caring more than just status quo or money, for HCI subject, someone close enough to replace the current old. Perfect doesnâ€™t matter, at least got two-three of my mentioned traits is ok. It suppose to lives up the name of interesting and easy to use knowledge/product.
