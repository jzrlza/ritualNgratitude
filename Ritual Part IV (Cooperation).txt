For just before starting cooperation
-I can take what I've learned from the international Singaporean adaptation to adapt to new environment
-I can be ready about my knowledges, skills, and my determination
-I can get to cooperation work place easily, saving time and money as much as possible
-I can get the job I can really do
-I can interview and do the resume to fit the needs of the company and my true abilities and my determination
-I can do any of these, game dev, front-end dev, security dev, blockchain dev
-I can get the cooperation workplace with the flexible morning time, late is ok but secondary


For during 6 months of cooperation, hope this is going smooth, along with extra phone fixing job
-I can keep my schedule time flexible and keep on the work
-I can do the work as long as I learn
-I can do the work and relax as the time fits
-I can ask whatever is new and important to learn, I can be reasonable a lot and calm and wise for the principle to get the success result
-I feel thankful that I can have good health self, parents, friends, bosses, managers, employers, employees, undlings, and many more valueable and to-be-valueable people.
I can be wisly kind to them, I wish from my pure heart for them to have well-being in long term
(There's more, I haven't discover more yet, I have to reach the time first to discover more)
