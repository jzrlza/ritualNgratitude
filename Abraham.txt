Abraham (shared, common [one] consciousness) = TAO. Abraham talks (all the time, by the way) about the very first of the Four Noble Truths: Life is suffering. The very immutable and eternal fact/law/"truth" says that when WE ARE expanding, we always experience (ackowledge, sense) contrast and diversity (maya, sansara, the [apparent] multitude of things) -- because "everything is two things": the Presence and the Absence of it". 
How would you know (sence, acknowledge, experience) "good" without the "not so good"? Even the very concept of "good" would make no "sense", in this case... They appear (dualities, maya) to be constrasting oposites, in order for us to experience it (play with it - Maha Lila); but they are, in essence, one and the same... Oneness, wholeness, non-duality... They are US, we are (also) it. We are all (together), in everything, everywhere. We are "ALL THAT IS"...
So, how we "play" (the "game" of living experience of ongoing expansion)? Through choice, or its absence; which is also a choice... Free-will... attention (focus), intention, thoughts, actions (deliberated or not, conscious AND uncouncious ["by default"])...
And how we know (sence etc) we are in the "right" path? Ultimately, we are the path. That is why Abraham states that "the path is always reveling itself to us", because we are all-ways expanding (our kNOWing, our experience of) our-SELVES... But I diverge. So, practically, how we know (and even better) sence we are on The Path (of least resistence) -- which was called The Middle Way, by Gautama; and The Narrow Path, by Jesus)? By (and throught) our e.motions, our feelings!!! The indicators, the compass, our everyday, always-there "signs" (witness, mirrors, projections) of what and where WE THINK we are... 
Are you feeling "good"? Then you are oriented towards "that witch you really are" [and never left]; you are "in alignment", in accordance, in bless, and joy... Are you not feeling (so) "good"? That is also "good", as well. in this case, you are just "telling yourself" you are pointing towards more expansion, more experience (more "play", more maya, more "illusion"). And that is fine, that is intended/expected... Just accept it (receive it), acknowlege it, embrace it, pass through it, LIVE IT. That is what you choosed, that's what you CREATED. There is no way you can deny it. You created it, and it is (now) you. It is now part of what you are, of what you choose to be, in this moment... And you will be just re-creating more of it, if you decide (freely, couscious or not) to deny it. Until you decide (choose, freely, by your on) to accept it and embrace it [and/or as Jesus says in ACIM, until you "deny to deny it'] 
Of course one can (always) choose different, but only from where one really is (or think [believe] one is). Acceptance, non-resistance... comunion, communication, contact, re-member-ing... knowledge, sence, counsciousness... God, Source, Self, Inner/Supperior Being, Allà, Tao, Nirvana, Christos, Heaven(s), Valhala... It (really) doesn't matter how you name (label) it [the native americans refers to "The Great Mistery"]; and just a few days ago I heard this idea that "that's really no such thing us 'unknown', just what is 'yet to be dis-covered' [revelead, des-velead, re-membered]...
It is really astonishing, amazing, amusing... Sansara is Nirvana, Earth is Heaven, We are God (playing the game of making as if we are-not). And all is good, All is fine, All is right (and wrong... or not, as we choose it to be, by the power of our free-will). It is all right... 

How powerful, and beautiful, and capable, and blessed, and playful we ALL are...
I -- myself -- use to say (to "play"): 
   I am not, I are. 
   [And, of course] 
   We are not, we IS!
IMHO, this is so Budha, so Jesus, so Abraham, so Bashar, so me, so you, so you and me...
Blessings﻿
