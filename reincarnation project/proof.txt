Sure, life is bitter pain
I want it to end quickly, but how?
Enjoy the last bit of it?

I would like to enjoy a bit more
as a girl with more freedomly rules

born around buisiness owner family ties

live in the technological world

Learn the basic of life
Born in scandinavia, Norway, Sweden or Finland for getting education. Or back to America if I'm ready to impact the world by my career. Or adventurous for Australia.

I must learn to have more mindful attitude as talent this life.

able to learn a lot by simulations, a few real expiriences

meet the reincarnation knowledge again, study spiritualitty as the main thing, fashions, works are second hand.

learn the truth about social and civilization as much as possible as a girl, (be sure to stay near groups)
adventure is to be learned as well
learn to love friends and family, learn to live with all genders and age, and sexuality
learn to live as a group of friends, even mixing opposite genders together

Once I'm done educated the basics
I can move on to the country of extremes, such as Japans, and/or America, more challenging countries to live in, with positive and creative challenges.

then when its over, come back as an adventurous asexual guy who create freedom, with team to make reincarnation more controllable, happiness easier to be saturated.
once happiness easily saturated, I can have more army of souls who are ready to help me free from reincarnation

imagine how many life does it take?
i cannot tell, it depends on my performance


My mission is to cure ignorance by enjoying new parts of life
stupid ignorance that is
