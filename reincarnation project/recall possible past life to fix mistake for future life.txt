-I could've been a dinosaur that killed by volcano before, that's why I had fear of going outside when I was young.
-I could've been a misandric young women abused by the patricial society before, yet wished to be strong and independant, dang, now I am a guy!
-I could've been a person who wish for the safest place possible on earth, free from disasters, maybe that's why I ended up in Thailand?
-I could've been a lazy spirit in heaven before, thinking only about spending life until the chances over, that's why I was pretty dumb at first.
-I could've been an arrogant bitch before, deep inside, that's why I am born in family with arrogant manners.
-I could've been a person who used to think, if I can do everything myself, that's why I'm such a loner, hard to fit to groups at first, yet shy as hell.
-I could've been murdered or killed by accident when I was young, somehow another reason why I am so afraid of my parents and other people at first.
-I could've been a person who is, well problably female, due to gender norms in past, stay-at-home daugther maybe? That's why I am not good at going outside.
-I could've been a person who thinks reality is harsh, and detest it by trying to hide and obscure self, that's why I am so into internet, games, cartoons, fantasy world, than reality!
							Yet, I also value these times more than reality time. Also better at Math than Social.
-I could've been a person who used a lots of social services, and high-class advantages before, that's why I felt liek I want that again, and want to have totally comfortable life
							rather than being an important co-worker of society! (Just how lazy and selfish my thinking was!)
-I could've been a person who look down on lower people, that's why I end up as aspie, being looked down.
-I could've been a person who vowed for the shortest safest route of life, rather than accepting challenges, that's why I meet Buddhism, maybe too soon? 
					I still haven't expirienced enough good moments here in this world!! I was scared of harsh times. Everywhere is challenge, I see now.
-I could've been an American before, but I didn't do anything much as an American problably, leaving the world in chaos, that's why I am good at English, and feels alienated by Thais.
					But I left the civilization of the world keep being insane, just If I had productive power.
-I could've been a person living my life aimlessly, accourding to social's mindless goal of industrail, That's why I am pretty dimwit and reckless thorugh out child, teenage and early young adult.
-Another, I could've been a mindless soul, or over-preservative soul, that's why I am born in a failed education system world.
-Another, I could've been a person who uses own's weakness as an excuse to deny duties and doing things nessisary for survival, that's why I am a lazy crybaby at first. (My inner farmer says this needs to be changed for the sake of self and the world)
					To fix this, I must have a sense of world development, this allows me to know what to do and don't, by proper reasons.
-I must've been a quite young soul, I am pretty childish in nature, but faces losses and unhappiness several times already, due to being immatured yet-to-learn-the-way-of-life soul.

That shall be enough


-Fix-

-Disasters are actually part of the world creation, a challenge of the world creation, just don't get in nature's way, try to know its process.
-The world creation process needs animals, humans as coworker to keep environment alive, after the rock, landmass, seas have formed. Knowing this is essential to be a happier older soul faster.
-It's bad to be young too long, suffering is boring and painful compare to joy and comforts, it's better to be an old soul quicker.
-The challenge in the world can be painful moment, unless if it is what I interested and enjoyed its pattern of problem solving,
					possible to enjoy if you know (like a game) how to win and how to prevent loosing. Yet impossible to give up without pain in the middle (not like in GAME)
-I must concern long-term factor of life, being and old soul as soon as possible more, not give up everything to just effortless luck.
-The project of that is, ummm I need more scientific proof of the reincarnation as well. Make sure I am in the life I can control and lead the reincarnation with such knowledge as much as possible.
