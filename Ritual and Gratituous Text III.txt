หลังเรียนจบ จะพัก ประมาณ 6-12 เดือน ก่อนทำงาน
เอาเวลาว่างมา หัดขับรถ หัดใช้ชีวิต หัดเดินทางเที่ยวเมืองนอก หัดสมดุลระหว่างเล่นกับงาน หัดเข้าสังคม หัดจัดสมดุลชีวิต หัดจัดการงบการเงินรายเดือน บริหารรายรับรายจ่าย
ถ้าเรามีประสบการณ์ดี พร้อม ทำงานเราก็พร้อม ไม่กลัวชีวิตพัง (อย่ารีบคิดไปทำงานเลย อย่ารีบคิดแค่อยากอยู่หอเฉยๆ เดี๋ยวก็พลาดอย่างที่เคยพลาด)
คือเอาเวลาว่างก้อนนี้ มาเรียนรู้สิ่งที่จำเป็น ซึ่งเราต้องคิดเอง อย่าให้พ่อแม่คิดให้

ทีหลัง เข้ามัธยม ก็ต้องมีจิตใจ หลักการ พร้อม มหาลัยก็เช่นกัน
